-	Serverless computing – use cloud, do not use server (outsourcing)
o	You have the ability to tell the cloud to do work
o	You provide the code, then do not have to worry about needing servers, how to do it, etc. 
	It is then the cloud providers problem (ex: Amazon) 

-	Unikernels – take container and make it even smaller 

-	Docker - Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, and system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. 
o	This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

-	Microservices – take a big app and chop it into smaller apps 
o	Ex: Target has a store locator, shopping, etc. 
	You would make the store locator its own app so you can update it individually without working on the whole site at once 
	It reduces bugs – if  store locator is down, the rest of the site is still up and running 
	Allows you to scale between smaller servers

-	Devops – bring developers together to get them to work together (vs. pointing fingers) 
o	Taking things that are hard and doing them more often
o	Ex: updates
